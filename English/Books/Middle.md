## C++

- [Scott Meyers - Effective Modern C++: 42 Specific Ways to Improve Your Use of C++11 and C++14](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Modern-Specific-Ways-Improve/dp/1491903996)

    It's a new chapter of a Scott Meyers books collection. This book contains a collection of advice about C++11/14 standards.

- [Anthony Williams - C++ Concurrency in Action](https://www.amazon.com/C-Concurrency-Action-Anthony-Williams/dp/1617294691/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=C%2B%2B+Concurrency+in+Action%3A+Practical+Multithreading&qid=1636314477&s=books&sr=1-3)

    This book is a guide for multithreading programming and using the standard library features. It contains detailed explanations about all primitives and their nuances "behind the curtain".

- Herb Sutter:
    - [Exceptional C++: 47 Engineering Puzzles, Programming Problems, and Solutions](https://www.amazon.com/Exceptional-Engineering-Programming-Problems-Solutions/dp/0201615622)
    - [Exceptional C++ Style: 40 New Engineering Puzzles, Programming Problems, and Solutions](https://www.amazon.com/Exceptional-Style-Engineering-Programming-Solutions/dp/0201760428) 
    - [More Exceptional C++: 40 New Engineering Puzzles, Programming Problems, and Solutions](https://www.amazon.com/More-Exceptional-Engineering-Programming-Solutions/dp/020170434X)

    The collection of books describes a lot of tasks related to designing or writing code in C++. They propose a collection of effective solutions. A lot of them are approved and declared as classic idioms. You will regularly find these idioms around projects.

- [Kurt Guntheroth - Optimized C++: Proven Techniques for Heightened Performance](https://www.amazon.com/Optimized-Proven-Techniques-Heightened-Performance/dp/1491922060)

    This book is a guidebook for the performance improvement of C++ applications. Some advice in this book is based on different idioms and tricks described in books of Herb Sutter or Scott Meyers. It's recommended to read this book after reading the books above.


## Hard skills

- [Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides or "Gang of Four" - Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612)

    This book is a classic guidebook of design patterns. Each pattern is precisely described and advised to a suitable use-case. This book is a good continuation of "Head First Design Patterns" by Eric Freeman. But be ready, this book is more complex than the previous one.

- [Gary McLean Hall - Adaptive Code](https://www.amazon.com/Adaptive-Code-Developer-Best-Practices/dp/0136891446)
    
    One of the best books that describe SOLID principles in simple terms. All code examples are written in C#, but it shouldn't be a problem as they were written in a simplistic way.

- [Robert Martin - Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164)
 
    One more work by Uncle Bob. For this time, this book will explain to you to think about the architecture of an application/component first before starting rushing with code writing. It shows where to pay attention upon analyzing a solution design. This book is a good start for people, who are interested in architecture tasks in software design and don't know where to begin. The knowledge from this book is common for a lot of engineers and will be useful to prevent widespread mistakes in software design.

- [Ulrich Drepper - What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory](https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf)

    This article is a good overview: how PC memory works and why it works in the described way. It shows not only high-level representation, but low-level aspects are also described (if you have an intention to dive in this area).
