# Why and what for the roadmap has been created?

C++ is actively used in many commercial projects. Throughout its history the language has undergone big changes. It made C++ much more convenient for day-to-day use. But a lot of speculation, myths and fears still hover around the language to scare off a large number of people who want to learn it. Our goal is to help beginners dispel the myths about the complexity of C++ and to help them to find their way to learn the language.

There is a shortage of developers in the market that can write in C++. Based on our experience, it seems that many active developers have learned the language because they had a very strong desire to learn it and not because it was easy to find information about the language. It is not often that you come across a person who has mastered C++ exclusively through training programs. A large proportion of educational platforms or courses cannot offer high-quality lessons: either a very high-level and abstract course is offered, or a course is simply outdated and is not relevant anymore. That is not enough to start successfully completing tasks in commercial projects.

The entry barrier into C++ development is still higher compared to other languages. Most of the available information targets active developers. This fuels myths about the exceptional complexity of the language. There is an extreme lack of relevant information for beginners.

This roadmap tries to fill the gap that has been formed. The idea of creation arose after a large number of interviews with inexperienced candidates for the position of a C++ developer. They showed common patterns: gaps in basic knowledge, lack of understanding on how to learn the language and where to get the knowledge from.

Also, the map can be useful for those who have already been practicing using C++ for some time in personal and work projects. It can help you to understand what knowledge you are lacking to deepen the level of language proficiency, as well as become a highly qualified specialist.
