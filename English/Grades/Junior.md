# :yum: Junior C++

## :question: Who is it?

It is a junior developer who has theoretical knowledge of software development and little practical experience from personal or educational projects. They may also have a theoretical understanding of how the industry works. Junior developers can perform simple tasks within a real project under the guidance of experienced colleagues.

## :computer: What coding abilities are expected?

- Ability to read documentation for libraries, frameworks, etc.
- Ability to gather and integrate third-party libraries into the project
- Ability to read and understand code written by other developers
- Ability to search for and fix bugs using the debugger or log data
- Ability to write tests for code
- Basic knowledge and hands-on experience with Git

## :bust_in_silhouette: What general skills are expected?

- Fast learning ability
- Ability to independently search for information on the Internet, books, etc.
- Ability to ask colleagues questions in a timely and appropriate manner
- Ability to work effectively in a team environment.

## :eyes: Tips and recommendations

- Try to find a group of enthusiastic individuals at your company and join them. They can be a source of knowledge and experience for you.
- Don't hesitate to ask questions to more experienced colleagues. There are no stupid questions, only poor answers.
- Don't get too absorbed in a task for too long. If after several attempts, you're unable to make progress, reach out to your colleagues for help immediately. They expect the task to be completed within a reasonable time frame. Your primary goal is to solve problems, not create them for the team.
- When faced with difficulties, try to come up with a few potential solutions on your own before seeking guidance from your mentor. Your mentor can then adjust or improve your solution.
- Junior developers often fall into the trap of thinking that writing more lines of code equates to being a better programmer. Don't make this mistake. The more code you write, the greater the likelihood of errors. Ideally, your code should be written in a way that when you return to it six months later, you can quickly understand what it does. A good developer is not someone who writes a lot of code, but rather behaves like a samurai, delivering one precise and effective strike instead of aimlessly swinging their sword.
