# Developers grading

> Grading - it's an approach to classify developers by their set of skills and experience. By means of grading it's possible to understand how to differentiate tasks difficulty with an expected set of skills to deal with it. 

Nowadays, you can meet the following common grading approach. It is possible to mark the following levels:
- Junior;
- Middle;
- Senior.

Each company has its own vision of developers grading and a set of skills/responsibilities declared for different levels. It's really simple to meet the following case: you will be promoted as a senior in a first company, but if you go to another one you will be assessed as a middle. Despite all, it's possible to introduce common expectations for each level. We will use a simplified approach declared before to describe each grade.
