# Language toolkit

Newborn developers have a limited understanding of the tools available, which make it easier to work with code, as well as increase efficiency and protect against many mistakes. All these tools are not a silver bullet for difficulties that language has for you, but they significantly smooth out the corners. Below is a list of common and popular tools recognized by developers around the world. This list is only a small part of the available tools. Over time, you will begin to better navigate them and find something new for yourself.

## Text editors

* **Visual Studio Code**

    Site: https://code.visualstudio.com/

    Price: free

    Powerful and efficient editor for text files and source code. Has a rich library of extensions that will allow you to customize it for yourself. It is also possible to customize it to work with source code: compile, run and debug. It has a powerful search engine for files and folders, which increases the efficiency of searching, reading and working with large projects.


* **Notepad++**

    Site: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

    Price: free

    Lightweight editor for text files and source code. Supports syntax and highlighting of common programming languages.

    Initially, Qt Creator was positioned as an IDE for developing graphical interfaces for applications in C++. But over the time, the framework has acquired tremendous opportunities. As a result, the framework has grown into a full-fledged ecosystem for developing cross-platform applications. It provides a large library of primitives for various needs: networking, graphical interface, database work, work with popular formats: images, text files, etc. Modern Qt Creator acts as a competitor for Visual Studio, but mostly it has gained developers who develop applications for various Linux distributions.
